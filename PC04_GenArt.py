********* HEY, READ THIS FIRST **********

This pattern was inspired by a quilt square. The background is an ombre of pink squares, and in the middle of
the pattern there is a star with 12 points. Each line and fill is a random tan color that have been selected
from a list of possible colors. Everytime you run the code, the tan star will look different.
